# RT
## RT is a rendering project of school 21(Ecole 42). It implements Path Tracing, Raytrace, Raymarching algorithm, uses GPU acceleration via OpenCL.

## All obhect with texture scene (Phong shading via Raytrace and Raymarching algorithm)

## Compiling and running
Runs on **OSX**.  
Run `make` and programm will compile.  
Run it with `./RT path_map path_texture`.  

## Controls
`ESC` - Close the program.  
`W`/`A`/`S`/`D` - Movement in space.    
`Hold the right mouse button and move it` - Movement in space.   
`UP`/`DOWN`/`RIGHT`/`LEFT` - Camera rotation.  
`Hold the left mouse button and move it` - Camera rotation.   
`Mouse wheel scroll` - zoom into / zoom out.   
`Z`/`X`/`C`/`V`/ - effects on / off.   
`2`-`4` - fsaa on(mouse event off it).   
`L` - path trace on / off (mouse event off it).   
`0` - screen shot.
